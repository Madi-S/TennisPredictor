"Explanation": "Too little head start is offered.Even -5.5 
would look doubtful, where you need to give -6.5, so this 
should be taken away.The level of the players is too different.
Alcotope zero.During the year, he won 2 matches out of 9 over 
the uttermost dumps.The very same plus or minus for adequate 
players flies away stably to zero and takes no more than 
4-5 games.There is no reception or delivery.The Japanese was 
once a strong player.Now he is practically an old man, but 
with great experience.So weak", "ExpertStats": 148.4}, 
{"Outcome": "Correct score 2: 0", "Odds": 1.57, 
    "Explanation": 
"1.6 at 2-0 is also a lot here.I would give no more than 1.3.I
don't know what needs to happen for the Japanese to give the
set.Even in the first round, he closed the talented Russian
Polukhin 2-0.Alcotop, who does not know how to play tennis
at all, should all the more fly away to zero.As I said, 
the level of the players is too different, where the 
Japanese were once very strong.He has great experience
and should not feel such rivals.", "ExpertStats": 148.4}]}]
